# sgx

This crate contains types for building an Intel SGX implementation.

Fully understanding the contents of this crate will likely require access
to the [Intel Software Developer Manual](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html).

How to use this crate partly depends on what you are trying to accomplish:

  1. If you are an enclave developer, you probably want the `parameters`
     and `ssa` modules.
  2. If you are signing an enclave, you probably want the `signature` and
     `crypto` modules.
  3. If you are developing an enclave loader, you probably want the
     `parameters` and `page` modules. However, you may also want the
     `signature` module to load a signature.
  4. If you are interested in quote parsing and validation, you probably
     want the `quote` module.
